This mod gives random chances to all sorts of things including but not limited to the possibilty of getting jade or gold from stonecutting instead of stone blocks and horribly ineffective cooks burning themselves at the stove.

    <!-- 

        CHECK RANDOM CHANCE VALUES BEFORE RELEASE

        - [DONE] equipping and unequipping power armors could come with a risk of pawns getting stuck in an inconvenient way
        - low level pawns with no passion in skill for required task
            - X cancels job: got bored, having a beer
        - poorly made art
            - pawns have chance to insult the artist, start social fights
        - "horse shoe pins could probably be a bit more dangerous too"
            - dart boards too
